      I started my career in the VFX industry where I worked as a Pipeline TD
      for 5 years. I had the opportunity to work on a Marvel Film, Love, Death
      and Robots and a few other cool projects. Currently I am working at The
      Gemini Solution as a software engineer, where my team and I are working
      with Carrick Wealth to develop their tech.
